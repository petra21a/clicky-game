## Assignment Challenge
In this assignment, we practiced the basics of React by creating a Memory style game. The goal was to implement components, deal with state, and life-cycle changes.

## Technical Approach
- The challenge of this assignment was grasping the concept of hoisting state to the common parent component. Pseudo-coding for React was very helpful in organizing and tracking the components as well as minimizing the time spent refactoring the props when changing associations. A challenge for expanding this Game would be incorporate css animation in with the onclick and state changes.
